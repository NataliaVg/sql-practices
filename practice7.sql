Cleanup data
Finding duplicates
Identify the columns 
Select them with group by and having

Find missing data (records with null values)
we can group and count
We can use nulls first on the order by

Constraints for some columns
  zip lenght must be 5

Steps to fix the data.
  1.- Create a backup table.
  CREATE TABLE <table name> as select <>
  2.- If it is possible create a new colu and work in the new col
    Fix the missing st values


1) Import data
